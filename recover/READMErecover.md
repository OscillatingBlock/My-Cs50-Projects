######JPEG Image Recovery Tool

This program recovers JPEG images from a memory card formatted for digital cameras. It scans the memory card for lost or deleted JPEG files and attempts to recover them.

###How it Works

The program reads the memory card (provided as a disk image file) and searches for recognizable JPEG file headers. If a valid header is found, the program attempts to extract the entire JPEG image data based on standard JPEG file format markers. Recovered images are written to separate files with sequential numbering (e.g., recovered_001.jpg, recovered_002.jpg, etc.).

###Usage

Compile the program:
```
Bash
gcc recover.c -o recover
```
Run the program:
```
Bash
./recover memory_card.img
```
Replace memory_card.img with the actual filename of your memory card image file, in this case it is card.raw file here.

###Requirements

C compiler (e.g., GCC)
###Note:

This program is a basic implementation for educational purposes. It might not recover all types of corrupted or fragmented JPEG files.
The program assumes the memory card image file is a raw disk image containing the exact contents of the memory card.
