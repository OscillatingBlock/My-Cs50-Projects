## My Programming Projects

This repository is a collection of projects I've created using various programming languages I'm learning. It serves as a space to showcase my progress and document my coding journey.

**Feel free to explore and learn from these projects!**

**Structure:**

Each project will have its own subdirectory within this repository. The subdirectory will ideally contain the following:

* **Source Code:** All the code files for the project.
* **README.md:** A brief description of the project, its functionality, languages used, and any relevant setup instructions.
* **Additional Files:** Any other files needed for the project, such as test cases, configuration files, or sample data.

**Languages:**

This repository will showcase projects using the following languages (or more, as I learn and grow):
c and python

**Contribution:**

While this repository primarily serves as my personal learning space, I welcome any suggestions or contributions. Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you have ideas for improvement!

**License:**

The projects in this repository will use a permissive license like MIT or Apache 2.0.  The specific license for each project will be mentioned in the respective subdirectory's README.
